    "I recently undertook a Data Challenge. The aim of the challenge was to practise some basic data processing and answer some questions for 3 data sets. I had 3 data sets:\n",

    "\n",
    "    1. leads.csv. This is a list of fictitious company directors, with some basic data about them and their company.\n",
    "    2. calls.csv. This is a list of fictitious calls made by an outbound call centre. The call centre consists of several agents, who make calls one after the other. They don’t get to choose who to call, the system does. The objective of the call is to get the lead to signup on the website. When they finish a call, they mark down the outcome, from a fixed list of possible outcomes. Note that a single lead may be called multiple times.\n",
    "    3. signups.csv. This is a list of leads who signed up after being called by someone from the call centre. Each signup was risk assessed and either approved or rejected for a loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "I then had some questions I wanted to answer: \n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tWhich agent made the most calls?\n",
    "2.\tFor the leads that received one or more calls, how many calls were received on average?\n",
    "3.\tFor the leads that signed up, how many calls were received, on average?\n",
    "4.\tWhich agent had the most signups? Which assumptions did you make? (note that there is a many-to-one relationship between calls and leads)\n",
    "5.\tWhich agent had the most signups per call?\n",
    "6.\tA lead from which region is most likely to be “interested” in the product?\n",
    "7.\tA lead from which sector is most likely to be “interested” in the product?\n",
    "8.\tGiven a lead has already expressed interest and signed up, \n",
    "a.\tsignups from which region are most likely to be approved?\n",
    "b.\tIs this statistically significant? Why?\n",
    "9.\tSuppose you wanted to pick the 1000 leads most likely to sign up (who have not been called so far), based only on age, sector and region.\n",
    "a.\tWhat criteria would you use to pick those leads?\n",
    "b.\tIn what sense are those an optimal criteria set?\n",
    "c.\tHow many signups would you expect to get based on those called leads, assuming they were being called by random agents?\n",
